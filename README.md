# Narc King
This is a re-implementation of an old text-based game where you learn supply, demand, investment and debt management by being a street dealer!
## Current Goals
This game is still undergoing initial delevopment. The initial goal is to get it to a point where a person can play it in the terminal with a TUI like ncurses. 

Later, if time permits, a full GUI will be implemented in GTK. However, we will likely support both UIs, as the logic shouldn't change that much.
